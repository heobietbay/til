Questions: Is there any way to get the origin of an alert box?

I work with some very large and confusing JavaScript files that I did not write. Sometimes an alert will come up but 
I don't know where it's coming from.
You could search all files for the text contained in the alert but if that text is dynamic it won't work.
Is there a way to set a breakpoint in order to intercept an alert?

Answer:
At the very top of your HTML:

window.alert = function() {
    debugger;
}
debugger is a statement that invokes any debugging functionality available.
With developer tools open, you'll automatically hit a breakpoint whenever alert is called. 
You can then inspect the call stack to see exactly what called the custom alert function.
